# Session-8(namedtuple)

## Overview

This Python module provides functionalities for generating fake profiles and stock data, along with statistical analysis of the generated data. The module leverages the `Faker` library to create realistic but fictitious profiles and companies, allowing for the simulation of large datasets for testing, analysis, or educational purposes. Additionally, the module includes functions to compute various statistics on the generated data, both for the profiles and the stock market values. The use of namedtuples and dictionaries provides flexibility in data handling and performance efficiency.

## Module Components

### 1. `Profile` and `Stock` Namedtuples

The module defines two namedtuples: `Profile` and `Stock`. 

- **Profile**: The `Profile` namedtuple is designed to store personal information, including the name, blood group, current location (latitude and longitude), and age. This structure is ideal for representing individuals' data in a compact and efficient manner.

- **Stock**: The `Stock` namedtuple is used to represent stock market data for companies. It includes fields for the company name, stock symbol, opening price, highest price during the day, closing price, and the stock's weight in the market. This structure allows for efficient storage and manipulation of stock market data.

### 2. `generate_profiles_using_named_tuples`

This function generates a list of fake profiles using the `Profile` namedtuple. It allows the user to specify the number of profiles to generate, with a default of 10,000. The generated profiles include randomly assigned names, blood groups, current locations, and ages. The function uses the `Faker` library to create these realistic profiles, making it useful for testing or simulating large datasets.

### 3. `calculate_statistics_tuples`

The `calculate_statistics_tuples` function takes a list of `Profile` namedtuples and computes several statistics:

- **Largest Blood Type**: This is determined by counting the occurrences of each blood group and identifying the most common one.
- **Mean Current Location**: The average latitude and longitude are calculated to determine the mean current location of all profiles.
- **Oldest Person Age**: The maximum age among the profiles is identified as the oldest person's age.
- **Average Age**: The mean age of all profiles is calculated.

These statistics provide valuable insights into the generated profiles, allowing for analysis of the distribution of blood groups, geographical locations, and age demographics.

### 4. `generate_profiles_using_dictionary`

This function is similar to `generate_profiles_using_named_tuples`, but instead of using namedtuples, it generates profiles as dictionaries. Each dictionary contains the same fields: name, blood group, current location, and age. This function provides an alternative for users who prefer working with dictionaries over namedtuples.

### 5. `calculate_statistics_dict`

The `calculate_statistics_dict` function operates on a list of profile dictionaries, similar to `calculate_statistics_tuples`. It computes the same set of statistics:

- **Largest Blood Type**: Most common blood group.
- **Mean Current Location**: Average geographical coordinates.
- **Oldest Person Age**: Maximum age.
- **Average Age**: Mean age.

This function offers flexibility by supporting the dictionary data structure, which some users may find more intuitive or easier to work with.

### 6. `fake_company_generator`

The `fake_company_generator` function creates a list of `Stock` namedtuples, representing fictitious companies and their stock market data. The function allows the user to specify the number of companies to generate, with a default of 100. For each company, it generates:

- **Name**: The company's name.
- **Symbol**: A randomly generated four-letter stock symbol.
- **Open Price**: The opening price of the stock.
- **High Price**: The highest price during the trading day, which is slightly above the opening price.
- **Close Price**: The closing price, which falls between the opening and high prices.
- **Weight**: A random weight assigned to the stock, used in market value calculations.

This function is useful for simulating stock market scenarios, enabling analysis of stock data and market behavior.

### 7. `calculate_market_value`

The `calculate_market_value` function computes the market value of stocks based on a specified price type: open, high, or close. The function takes a list of `Stock` namedtuples and a price type as input. It calculates the weighted average market value by considering the weights assigned to each stock. The result is a single market value representing the selected price type.

This function is valuable for financial analysis, allowing users to evaluate market conditions based on different price points.

## Conclusion

This Python module offers a comprehensive set of tools for generating and analyzing fake data, including profiles and stock market information. By utilizing namedtuples and dictionaries, it provides flexibility in data handling, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from testing to educational purposes. The statistical analysis functions included in the module allow users to gain insights into the generated data, enhancing their understanding of data distribution and behavior. Overall, this module is a powerful resource for anyone needing to work with large datasets or simulate real-world scenarios in a controlled environment.
